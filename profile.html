        <h1>Hey! I'm Court.</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my place in cyber-<strong>space</strong>.</p>
        <p>I am an amateur writer, artist, and reader.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I write about my personal life and thoughts. Just shit I need to get out of my head.</li>
            <li>I draw fanart of fictional characters that I like. I live and die by <a href="https://www.systemax.jp/en/sai/">PaintTool SAI</a>.</li>
            <li>I read a variety of things. Memoirs, social commentary, and manga interest me most these days.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Offline, I am a full-time professional living and working in a mid-sized U.S. city. I recreationally enjoy sipping lavender lattes, annoying my cats, and staring at the ceiling for hours.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking an interest in my inner world. I hope you choose to stay awhile.</p>
