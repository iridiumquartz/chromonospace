                        <p>I'm a twenty-something year old cat lady living somewhere in the United States.</p>
                        <p>I spent my early years surfing the internet of the aughts, so I designed my digital <strong>space</strong> here to be reminiscent of that era.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this project is artistic and personal expression.<br>
                        There is no cohesive theme other than sharing my interests and thoughts. If the content here happens to interest you, that's a great bonus! 
                        </p>
