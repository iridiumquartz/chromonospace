<p>It’s been a minute since I published anything. I started this blog in April of 2025, and it seems that my general theme up until now has been processing grief – unintentional, just the way it’s been organically shaking out. I take my silence here as a sign that I’ve put that particular demon on my shoulder to rest at last, and so now I feel a bit lost as to what to write about.</p>

<p>I think my greatest accomplishment of 2025 was finding the courage to accept and publicize my grief. I got better at sitting with and expressing my emotions, both here and in the "real world" with the "real people". I rejected shame and embraced my own humanity, regardless of how "cringe" or "self-interested" I feared that others would perceive me.</p>

<p>As the weather has been getting colder and greyer here in Pittsburgh, though, sadness has been creeping back in. It’s been more focused on self-critique, expecting too much of myself, and fighting the voices of my past that no longer belong to me. And so, the pen (ahem... keyboard) beckons again.</p>

<p>Right off the coattails of the last brute that I got myself entangled with, the latter half of 2025 brought a new man into my life who has shown me so much kindness, patience, and genuine care that I sometimes struggle to believe that he isn’t punking me somehow. Thanks to my previous relationships and certain aspects of my upbringing, I internalized the belief that I am inherently unlovable because I am too sensitive and ask for too much. As a result, I have to constantly fight my own vigilance and resistance to accepting that maybe this one simply does, in fact, genuinely want to inconvenience himself for the sake of my happiness.</p> 

<p>Rejecting the belief that I’m not worth loving is an exhausting and constant practice these days, but of all the problems I could ask for I’m thankful that it’s this one. It’s not a mess that logic can untangle – it’ll take time to get there, and it’s my responsibility to be kinder and more gentle with myself in turn.</p>

<p>2026 will be the year that I enter my thirties, and as arbitrary as numbers are, I’m still excited for what awaits me in my next decade.</p> 

<p>I have no overarching goals for 2026. My intention is to simply continue being and learning.</p>
