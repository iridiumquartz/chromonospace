                <p>Stunningly, yesterday was a good day. And for no particularly good reason. It was a day as ordinary as any other by all other accounts.
                <p>I haven't had a good day in awhile. Good minutes and hours, yes, but a whole day with no emotional phantom tapping me on the shoulder? That's novel.</p>
                <p>The phantom is back today, but I feel a bit calmer sitting beside him knowing that good days are becoming possible for me again.

                <p>Despite having lost, I don't regret having loved. I hope I planted a seed that will grow into something beautiful for you one day. You deserve it more than you believe you do.</p>
