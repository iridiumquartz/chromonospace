                <p>I’m thrilled to report that life is starting to turn around for me! The literal and emotional winter is coming to an end at last. 

                <p>This past week, I’ve had more good days than bad. I can feel my nervous system starting to relax now that I know I’m finally starting to settle down and there are no more changes coming anytime soon. 
                    
                <p>Living in the city is a huge boon to my mental health. I know not everybody is a city person, but I definitely am happiest when I’m close to other people and not dependent on a car. My neighborhood is quiet yet well connected to the rest of the city via ample public transportation. All of my essentials are within walking distance, of which I take full advantage. I live near a big beautiful park in which I’ve taken back up jogging. I’m even thinking about purchasing a bicycle to commute to work on nicer days.
                    
                <p>Reconnecting with old friends has been a treat. It’s so nice to catch up and hear about how their lives have developed while I’d been moved away to another state. I’m even getting to meet new friends through the old ones. My post-college social life has never been so vibrant! And in my true introverted spirit, it makes getting home afterward to recharge all the more sweet. 
                    
                <p><em>The Alchemist</em> by Paul Coelho resonates with me lately. Just like protagonist's journey, I restlessly searched for my personal “treasure” in the furthest corners of the world and within the wrong people. Yet, it turns out my treasure may have been here at home all along with my family and friends. I finally am starting to feel like I belong somewhere. 
                
                <p>The popular message online is that "you don’t need anybody but yourself." And sure — to survive, that’s true. But to thrive? My current opinion (which is subject to change - I always welcome a good debate) is that it's not true for many people. I'm discovering that I need other people in order to thrive. Caring for them, creating memories with them, and existing in relation to them brings purpose and joy to my life over any career, material possession, or travel excursion.
                
                <p>I tried the whole fierce independence/self-reliance thing, and while it does boost my confidence knowing that I can walk through the world capable of handling anything, I also think it's coping mechanism that's easy to develop when you're used to other people letting you down. It's less scary to try handling everything on your own rather than risk opening up to somebody who you assume is going to fail you like all the others. The key is finding people who are loving, trustworthy, and reliable. How are we supposed to heal relational trauma outside of the context of relationships, anyway?</p>
                    
                <p>I'll say that nights are still pretty hard because that’s when I tend to contemplate my recent past. Deep in my chest, I still carry the hurt of being ghosted by somebody I thought would always be there for me. At least I know that if I simply allow the emotions flow through me, the burden feels a tiny bit lighter each time. 
                <hr>
                <p>Only time will tell if these positive sentiments are temporary due to the novelty of this new chapter in my life and/or the relief from all the recent pain. What am I talking about? Of course they are. Emotions and feelings are fleeting. I’m only human, after all. The stormy days will come again, but the sun is sure to follow.
