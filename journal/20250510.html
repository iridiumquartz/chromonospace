                Others with perfectionist tendencies may relate to feeling like a failure on days that you can't hold everything together and can't help but succumb into a puddle of overwhelm and grief.
                
                <p>This shame feels crushing, and it inflames all of my insecurities of being inadequate and unworthy. What happened to the badass that walks through the world with confidence, measuredness, and fearlessness of speaking her mind? I know she's me, so where did she go? This is a different me, a me that I wish I could shove away in a closet for showing up at all. 

                <p>Shame is a nasty little emotion, and it thrives in darkness and in silence. What should I do about it, then? Let's cast a spotlight on it. 
                
                <hr>
                Where is this coming from, I wonder?
                <p>I recall times that I dared to peel back my armor and show my vulnerable side to somebody I thought trustworthy. This only earned me a puncture wound straight to the heart and re-affirmation of my greatest fear - abandonment. <br><em>“Why can't you just be happy? We could've had a good day and you ruined it.” "You're not the person I thought you were after all,”</em> the voices echo. 
                <p>
                And so, I have internalized that I'm not lovable when I'm not a completely put together boss lady with sunshine radiating out of my ass. My pain is an inconvenience and causes people to run. 
                <p>The objective analysis I have of this recurring theme is that the people who abandoned me were just the wrong people who only wanted me when I was easy, at my best, in my 'cool girl doesn't give a damn about anything' energy. I could be more generous in my evaluation, too: They had limited capacity for handling a three-dimensional human because they hadn't yet learned how to reconcile their own difficult emotions. They ESPECIALLY could not handle it when their very own actions were the direct cause of my distress. That's typically the catalyst for being discarded in my experience. 
                <p>One person in particular told me he needed somebody "rock solid", and that's why we weren't compatible. Which I now begin to wonder if that means "unshakable perfection that will put up with endless amounts of my juvenile bullshit and won't hold me accountable for any of it." 

                <p>I suppose I'll never know for sure. 
                
                <hr>
                
                <p>I am struggling to emotionally unlearn this sentiment of unlovability, even though rationally I know much better. Rationally, I know that I am capable of being loved when my emotions are inconvenient, because I have the capacity to love others in that way. The problem is that my brain and my heart are often out of sync and don't really communicate well with one another. That is the grandest problem of my life that I'm still trying to solve. 
                
                <p>I look back on older entries here and realize that when I publish, it's often in the aftermath of processing, the conclusions I've come to with a positive "glaze" on them. I'm really good at glazing as it turns out. I guess it's one of my coping strategies - glazing the donuts, turning lemons into lemonade, etc. - except that I'm so good at it that I tend to dwell in it much longer than most people probably do, looking to scrape out any last ounce of meaning. 

                <p>Do I do this purely for my own processing? Or is there an internal ulterior motive, to make myself look “presentable” and “palatable” to an outside audience so I can redeem my lovability?
                <p>It's a question I'll continue to ponder. For now, here I am without the glaze, without the sugar. Yeah, I'm trying to be okay but I'm not. Will I ever be? I don't know. Doesn't feel much like it now.
                
                <p>That's the nature of life though - ebbing and flowing, highs and lows...
                
                <p>... Oh, there's the glaze again.
