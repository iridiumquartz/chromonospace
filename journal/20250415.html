                Hi there! If you're reading this, that means <strong>chromonospace</strong> is live. Woohoo!
                <hr>
                <p>
                How did I come up with the name <strong>chromonospace</strong>? I've always loved monospace fonts because they feel like a representation of my personality — straightforward, practical, and kind of techy-nerdy. The <strong>chromo</strong>- prefix is an alliterative choice and inspires the prismatic-type accent coloring. And of course, <strong>space</strong> can be used as a play on words to refer to the fact that this is my own corner of the internet. I must admit that I'm usually terrible at naming things, so I'm really proud of this one.
                <p>
                My <strong>space</strong> here has been passively in the works for some months now. I spent the bulk of that time learning HTML/CSS from scratch. I've always been a highly creative person and love exploring different outlets for that creativity, so it's been a treat to learn some web design skills. If you're a web developer, don't inspect my page if you value your sanity — I'm sure my amateur spaghetti code will melt your brain.
                <p>
                Please note that this website is best viewed on desktop. I'd very much like to claim that's by design (to harken back to the good ol' days of the internet) but truthfully it's because I have no idea how to optimize for mobile yet. It's not high on my priority list right now, so I don't know if or when that will happen. 
                <p>
                Thanks for visiting! I hope you'll stop by again soon.
