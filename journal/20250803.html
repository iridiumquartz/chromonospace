                <p>I keep going back and forth on whether I should keep  <strong>chromonospace</strong> attached to my real-life public persona or if I should keep it reserved for an anonymous alias. It has been on and off my socials more times than I can count. It goes up in moments I feel empowered and confident, and comes right back down in the moments I feel unsure of myself.

                <p>I have always wanted to share my creations with the world in some capacity but have always felt too scared. I still feel scared. For better or for worse, it took the “inciting event” of my latest breakup to push me over the edge and actually hit publish. And so <strong>chromonospace</strong> was born. 
                
                <hr>
                
                <p>It was one of the canon events of a straight woman's life. 
                
                <p>A man confesses feelings for you and pursues a relationship with you. You decide to give him a chance and end up falling head over heels for him. You finally feel safe enough to let your walls down, trusting that his actions will match his words. You fully commit yourself to him thinking, finally, I've found my person. Using your most precious resources - time, money, energy, affections - you cross oceans to be with him. 
                </p>

                <p>He takes from you everything he can before the mask slips and he hits you with the switch-up. <em>“You're an amazing woman, but you deserve better than me. I'm not ready for a relationship."</em>

                <p>What... the... f%$&.

                <p>Wait, I've heard this story before. Did I just get played? What? Hello? Am I a dumbass?

                <p>Fade to black.

                <hr>

                <p>We tried the whole friends thing for a couple months (the other canon event) which just ended in me getting screamed at on the phone and blocked. 

                <p>I never understood that emotional pain could manifest as acute physical pain until that moment. My heart felt literally broken and I felt genuinely ill for a long, long time. 

                <p>Journaling privately, writing unsent letters - those all helped a bit, but they didn't fulfill my visceral need to be witnessed. I deserved the agency and <strong>space</strong> to express myself to him after the bullshit he pulled on me. That was the very least he could do short of a profound apology. Instead of being an adult and facing the music of accountability, he postured today's trendy posture of “detachment” and slammed the door in my face. Erased me like a passing mistake. I felt so invisible and insignificant. Bereft and alone... collapsed on the ground, gasping for air after choking on my own tears. 

                <p>But nobody heard.

                <hr>

                <p>This experience, despite the edge of its blade having dulled with the passage of time, still marks me deeply. I still don't feel capable of trusting another human being and don't know if I ever will. The only vision for my life moving forward is one of singledom, coping with loneliness as a resigned alternative to the pain of risking that type of betrayal again. 

                <p>I know he feels this way too. He passed it to me like an emotional contagion. One I never asked for and now carry as my own personal burden, undaring to risk spilling it onto someone else.

                <p>In my pursuit to reject the invisibility he assigned to me, sometimes I feel liberated having my stories, emotions, and narratives  "out there". Other times I feel so exposed and isolated, like I'm floating around the endless expanse of <strong>space</strong> with a blindfold on. Those are the moments my courage falters, and I yank this <strong>space</strong> back into hiding.
                
                <p>You know that bully in your head? I have one too. Here's what she tells me:
                
                <p><em>“Do you think you're important or something? Nobody cares what you have to say.”
                
                <p>“They will think you are cringe for whining on the internet like an annoying little lamb.”
                
                <p>“You need to stop wasting your time crying about that loser and move on with your life.”</em>
                
                <p>Maybe one day I'll find the strength to sustain my courage to stop pulling this website down. Maybe one day I will believe I deserve to be witnessed, despite everything.
