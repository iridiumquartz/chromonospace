                <p>It's been awhile. Two months? I went into hiding for a bit, and by golly I'll do it again.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Summer is here. 
                
                <p>I've been loving all of the events my city is hosting. We're all a bit happier and more socially active over here. This is a wonderful thing... and it also means my battery is running on empty more often. I am a sleepier girl than usual, and I was already sleepy to begin with.
                
                <p>My great-great-great-great ancestors were from northwestern Europe. They were not as accustomed to the oppressive sun or this brand of sticky heat. Yet, here I am, dealing with it in a sweaty armpit of the United States. </p>

                <p>In comparison to Europe, I've come to learn that the US has more volatile weather patterns (hotter summers, colder winters, larger swings) due to its continental climate. My particular geographic area is not known for being "hot" per se, but it is in a valley that traps a lot of storm clouds, heat, and humidity. If compared on a map, latitude-wise, we're about on-par with Mediterranean countries like Italy and Spain. I've been to one of those, and it was lovely, but it was also September and by the ocean.</p>

                <p>Speaking of genetic heritage, there's the English kicking in to complain about the weather. If you're English, I'm not sorry. (You’re not offended.)</p>

                <hr>

                <p>In contrast to the climate, my emotional landscape has cooled down considerably compared to the past winter and spring. I've settled into slow-paced rhythms of cooking, cleaning, working, and generally just living life at a Ghibli pace. It's been lovely most times, but tear-jerkingly boring at others.</p>

                <p>I’ve built some semblance of order at last. Brick by brick, with gritted teeth and eyes weathered by salt and steel. Now, I feel the pendulum swinging back. Maybe it’s finally time for a little chaos.</p>
