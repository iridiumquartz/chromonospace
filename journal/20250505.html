            <p>Once I’m granted the relief of niceties, I’m a pretty straight shooter. I say exactly what’s on my mind and I don’t play guessing games. That is to say, I’m not particularly mysterious.</p>
            <p>My latest romantic encounter revealed himself to value a woman of mystery. A miscalculation on my part, as I believed he saw his fellow human in me.</p>
            <p>I'm no puzzle to solve. Is that why you're gone? Am I too open of a book? No fun? No challenge? Hm.</p>
            <p>Ghosting seems to be too light a term. “Tossed in the garbage” feels more apt.</p>

            <strong>Years ago</strong>...
            <p>The world sleeps.<br>Embers crackle.<br>Our tears spill.<br>We dance.<br>Oh... I’m smiling?
            <p>For what feels like the very first time, I feel deeply seen. You are a diamond in the rough, my dearest friend. I’ve never met anyone else like you.</p>
            <p>If only he loved me like you could.</p>
            <hr>
            <strong>Years later</strong>...
            <p>We reunite in a far-off land.</p>
            <p>Your eyes sparkle a little brighter now. How you’ve evolved! How I’ve grown! Just look at us, together.</p>
            <p>The waves lap at our feet. Physically weary, emotionally whole. 
            <p>Reignition.<br>Reconnection.<br>I’m no gnostic, but this feels like divine intervention.
            <hr>
            <strong>Now</strong>.
            <p>That dissonance — how I loved you versus how you let me down — is a serrated little pill lodged firmly in my throat. Agonizing to choke down. The metallic red spills down my gullet and stains my soul.</p>
            <p>It’s been months since you cast me away wordlessly. Was I ever real to you, or just a passing distraction?
            <p>My tires keep spinning, yet I’m stalled. The treads are worn; there’s no bite anymore. 
            <p>I can hear your voice in my head again. "You’re playing the victim." Dear, don’t you know how desperate I am to understand you? You fear being misunderstood so gravely, yet your deafening silence permits my monkey mind to write the story for you.
            <p><p>You’re the greatest heartbreak of my life, my dearest friend. I warned you it would be so.
            <hr>
            When night falls, I lie awake trying to figure out what the hell I keep doing wrong. Why do the ones I see the world in walk away like I was never real? If it keeps happening, maybe I am the common denominator. Or maybe this is karmic retribution from some fabled past life.
            <p>For the nth time, I tearfully drift into slumber. This time, I hope its embrace cradles me forever.
