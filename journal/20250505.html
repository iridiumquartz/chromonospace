            <p>Once I’m granted the relief of niceties, I’m a pretty straight shooter. I say exactly what’s on my mind and I don’t play guessing games. That is to say, I’m not particularly mysterious.</p>
            <p>My latest romantic encounter revealed himself to value a woman of mystery. A miscalculation on my part, as I believed he saw a fellow human when he gazed into me. “Human” - a flawed character deserving of space for kindness, patience, and decency.</p>
            <p>I'm no such puzzle to solve. I'm just a person who speaks plainly and in</p>
            <p>Is that why you're gone? Am I too open of a book? No fun? No challenge? Hm. Ghosting seems to be too light a term. “Tossed in the trash” feels more apt.</p>

            <strong>Years ago</strong>...
            <p>The world sleeps.<br>Embers crackle.<br>Our tears spill.<br>We dance.<br>Oh... I’m smiling?
            <p>For what feels like the very first time, I feel deeply seen. You are a diamond in the rough, my dearest friend. I’ve never met anyone else like you.</p>
            <p>If only he loved me like you could.</p>
            <hr>
            <strong>Years later</strong>...
            <p>We reunite in a far-off land.</p>
            <p>Your eyes sparkle a little brighter now. How you’ve evolved! How I’ve grown! Just look at us, together.</p>
            <p>The waves lap at our feet. Physically weary, emotionally whole. 
            <p>Reignition.<br>Reconnection.<br>I’m no gnostic, but this feels like divine intervention.
            <hr>
            <strong>Now</strong>.
            <p>The dissonance between how I would treat you and how you treated me is a serrated little pill lodged firmly in my throat. Agonizing to choke down. The metallic red spills down my gullet and stains my soul.</p>
            <p>It’s been months since you cast me away wordlessly. You didn’t even look back. Was it that easy for you? Was I ever real to you, or just a passing blur?
            <p>My tires keep spinning, yet I’m stalled. The treads are worn; there’s no bite anymore. 
            <p>I can hear your voice in my head again. “You’re playing the victim.” Dear, don’t you know that I’m desperate to understand you? You fear being misunderstood so gravely, yet your deafening silence permits my monkey mind to write the story for you.
            <p><p>You’re the greatest heartbreak of my life, my dearest friend. I warned you it would be so.
            <hr>
            When the curtain of dusk falls, I lie here wondering what I do so wrong that makes every person who matters to me discard me so brazenly. If it stinks everywhere I go, it’s probably just me, right? It’s gotta be me.
            <p>Maybe this is karmic retribution from some fabled past life.
            <p>For the nth time, I tearfully drift into slumber. This time, I hope I sleep forever.
